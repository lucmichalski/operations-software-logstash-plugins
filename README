Build and deploy repository for logstash plugins used
in wikimedia deployments

# Build

Run the included `./build.sh` script to create a new version of
the plugin deployment pack. Every deployed build MUST have a new
version number.

# Commit

The zip files in this repository are managed by `git-fat`. See references
for more details. Upload the built plugin pack as described by `build.sh` after
a succesful build. After uploading commit both the new .zip of the plugin pack
and the updated plugins-latest.zip symlink.

# Deploy

Utilize trebuchet on the deployment master to update and sync out a new version
of the plugin pack. Logstash hosts, upon seeing a plugins-latest.zip with a
different hash than their last install, will automatically install the pack.
Logstash must be manually restarted, preferably in a rolling fashion, after
deploying a new plugin pack.
